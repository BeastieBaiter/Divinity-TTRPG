The amount of Memory Slots determines how many [[Skills]], a creature can have slotted at one time. Only [[Skills]] that have been slotted can be used.

All players start with 3 slots of memory at Level One, and gain 1 slot for each point in the [[Attributes#Memory (MEM)|Memory]] and 1 slot at every even level.

[[Skills]] can require between 1 to 3 slots.

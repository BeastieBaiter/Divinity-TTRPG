Defences can broke down into 3 categories, Physical and Magical Armor that is affect by the attributes of the players [[Gear#Armor|armor]] and [[Skills]] and Elemental Resistances which can be affected by [[Gear]], [[Skills]], [[Proficiencies]], [[Talents]] and [[Status Effects]].
## Physical Armor
___
The Physical Armor value affects your [[Damage#Physical Damage|Physical Damage]] absorption. **One Physical Armor point absorbs one point of [[Damage#Physical Damage|Physical Damage]]**. 

When you received [[Damage]] from a physical attack, you first decrease the value of your Physical Armor before your [[Vitality (HP)]]. Your Physical Armor current value can decrease during a battle, so when it hits 0, your [[Vitality (HP)]] will take the full amount of damage. Your Physical Armor can be restored upon resting.

Physical Armor is also used to block [[Status Effects#Physical Status Effects|Physical Status Effects]], as long as Physical Armor is above zero, physical statuses like [[Status Effects#Knocked Down|Knocked Down]] or [[Status Effects#Crippled|Crippled]], can not take effect as long Physical Armor exists.
## Magic Armor
___
The Magic Armor value affects your [[Damage#Magic Damage|Magic Damage]] and your [[Damage#Elemental Damage|Elemental Damage]] (fire, water, air, earth and poison). **One Magic Armor point absorbs one point of [[Damage#Magic Damage|Magic Damage]]/[[Damage#Elemental Damage|Elemental Damage]]**. 

[[Defences#Elemental Resistances|Elemental Resistances]] apply before affecting Magic Armor, so when you received [[Damage]] from a magic attack or elemental source, you first apply the [[Defences#Elemental Resistances|Elemental Resistances]], then decrease the value of your Magic Armor before your [[Vitality (HP)]]. Your Magic Armor current value can decrease during a battle, so when it hits 0, your [[Vitality (HP)]] will take the full amount of damage. Your Magic Armor can be restored upon resting.

Magic Armor is also used to block [[Status Effects#Magic Status Effects|Magic Status Effects]] and [[Status Effects#Elemental Status Effects|Elemental Status Effects]]  is above zero, magical statuses like [[Status Effects#Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Status Effects#Burning|Burning]], can not take effect as long Physical Armor exists.
## Elemental Resistances
___
Elemental Resistances reduce the amount of damage taken from their respective element by the amount of point in said resistance. For example, 2 points in Water Resistance would mean the damage taken from water-based attacks will be reduced by 2 points.

These resistances can range from negative to positive. If a resistance is negative it will increase the damage taken by respective type of attack by the resistance value. If a resistance value is over the damage taken by respective type of attack, the overflow will turn into healing instead. Example

- If the Water Resistance of a creature is **-2**, it means that creature will receive additional 2 damage to any water-based attack it receives.
- If the Water Resistance of a creature is **10**, but the **damage received** by the water-based attack is **5**, it means that creature will not only block the full 5 damage of the attack, but will also heal its [[Vitality (HP)]] by 5 points (10 - 5 = 5).

There are 5 types of resistances:
- **Fire Resistance** - Affects damage taken from [[Skills#Pyrokinetic|Pyrokinetic]] and fire-based attacks.
- **Water Resistance** - Affects damage taken from [[Skills#Hydrokinetic|Hydrokinetic]] and water-based attacks.
- **Earth Resistance** - Affects damage taken from [[Skills#Geokinetic|Geokinetic]] earth-based attacks.
- **Air Resistance** -  Affects damage taken from [[Skills#Aerokinetic|Aerokinetic]] air-based attacks.
- **Poison Resistance** - Affects damage taken from Poison-based attacks.

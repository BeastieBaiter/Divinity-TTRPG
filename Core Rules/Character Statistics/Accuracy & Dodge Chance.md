## Accuracy Chance
Some attacks need to beat a check in order to successfully hit the target, either from a [[Gear#Weapons|Weapons]] or [[Skills]]. When a player wants to make these attacks they must make Accuracy Check roll (d20) and it can be calculated using the following formula:

<center><b>Accuracy = d20 + Proficiencies Values (if applicable) ± any Status Effects or inherent Debuffs</b></center>

 [[Status Effects]], or any other source of damage not mentioned above, will usually pre-determined.
## Rule Option #1: Dodge Chance (DC)
When creature a makes a Attack from [[Gear#Weapons|Weapons]] or [[Skills]], they must make Accuracy Check roll (AC) against Dodge Chance (DC) of the creature being attacked. A attack is considered successful if the roll is equal or higher to the DC of the creature being attack.

Every creature has **base DC of 2**, however this can be increase with any bonuses the creature might have to Dodge Chance from [[Skills]], [[Talents]], [[Proficiencies]], [[Status Effects]] and [[Gear]].

So the final formula looks like this: 

<center><b>DC = 2 + bonuses</b></center>

## Rule Option #2: Contested Roll
When creature a makes a Attack from [[Gear#Weapons|Weapons]] or [[Skills]], they must make Accuracy Check (AC) roll (d20) against the defenders Dodge Chance (DC) roll. A attack is considered successful if the AC roll is equal or higher to the DC roll: 

A creature **AC and DC** can be increase with any bonuses the creature might have to Accuracy or Dodge Chance respectively, from [[Skills]], [[Talents]], [[Proficiencies]], [[Status Effects]] and [[Gear]]:

When combat is initiated the [[Game Master|GM]] will call for a Initiative Check in order the determine the order of the combat encounter.
## Determining the Initiative Value
___
To determine the initiative of a creature, you take the value of **[[Attributes#Wits (WIT)|WIT]]** that creature and add any **bonuses from [[Gear]], [[Status Effects]], [[Skills]], or [[Talents]]** that might be added. 

<center><b>Initiative Value = WIT + bonuses</b></center>
### Rule Option #1 - d20 Initiative
Instead of a straight value determining the Initiative Value you can add a **d20** to formula for some added variety and chance variation.

<center><b>Initiative Value = d20 + WIT + bonuses</b></center>
#### Rule Option #1.2 - d4 Initiative
If your looking for smaller value that are closer together in variation, you can add a **d4** to the formula instead of a **d20**. This adds variety and chance variation but at a much smaller scale. This could to allow player to act mush closer together in turn order, providing the opportunity for combos (provided you're not using the Alternating Initiative rule).

<center><b>Initiative Value = d4 + WIT + bonuses</b></center>
## Alternating Initiative
___
After determining Initiative values, the team with the highest Initiative acts first. Teams then alternate turns (Team A Member 1 → Team B Member 1 → Team A Member 2 → etc.). When a team member is eliminated, the alternating pattern may be disrupted, potentially allowing consecutive turns for the same team.

This alternating pattern is also disrupted by [[Summons]] as they always right after their [[Summoner]].

Who acts in which turn is decided by [[Player]]s and [[Game Master|GM]] for their respective teams.
### Rule Option #2 - Decreasing Order of Initiative
Instead of using the alternating turn orders, you order the turns by decreasing Initiative Values. Meaning you order the Initiative Values in decreasing order and that becomes your turn order. The higher the Initiative value, the earlier in turn order the creature acts.

## Rule Option #1: Dodge Class (DC)
When creature a makes a Attack from [[Weapons]] or [[Skills]], they must make Accuracy Check roll (d20) against Dodge Chance (DC) of the creature being attacked. A attack is considered successful if the roll is equal or higher to the DC of the creature being attack.

Every creature has **base DC of 2**, however this can be increase with any bonuses the creature might have to Dodge Chance from [[Skills]], [[Talents]], [[Proficiencies]], [[Status Effects]] and [[Gear]].

So the final formula looks like this: 

<center><b>DC = 2 + bonuses</b></center>

## Rule Option #2: Contested Roll
When creature a makes a Attack from [[Weapons]] or [[Skills]], they must make Accuracy Check (AC) roll (d20) against the defenders Dodge Chance (DC) roll. A attack is considered successful if the AC roll is equal or higher to the DC roll: 

A creature **AC and DC** can be increase with any bonuses the creature might have to Accuracy or Dodge Chance respectively, from [[Skills]], [[Talents]], [[Proficiencies]], [[Status Effects]] and [[Gear]]:

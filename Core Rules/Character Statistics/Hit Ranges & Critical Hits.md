## Ranges of Bonus Damage Table
The table below shows how the damage of an Attack can change as determined by the result of the Check.

| Check vs Defense | Result       | Damage                |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Lower            | Miss        | No Damage             |
| Equal or greater | Hit         | Base Damage           |
| +5 or greater    | Heavy Hit   | Base Damage + 1       |
| +10 or greater   | Brutal Hit  | Base Damage + 2       |

## Critical Hits
When you roll a **20** on a **d20** for an Attack, it’s considered a **Critical Success Hit**.  
The Hit automatically **Hits** the target and applies the [[Critical Hit Multiplier]] to the Damage.

When you roll a **1** on a **d20** for an Attack, it’s considered a **Critical Failure**.  
The Hit automatically fails to **Hit** the target and **can** cause a additional complication to player determined by the DM.

## Hit Ranges and [[Attributes#Wits (WIT)|Wits]]
**Each 4 points** in Wits above 0 reduces the the threshold of both **Critical Success Hits** and **Ranges of Bonus Damage**. Meaning, for a player player character with 4 points in [[Attributes#Wits (WIT)|Wits]], a Hit is considered a **Heavy Hit** at **+4 or greater** instead of **+5 or greater**, a **Brutal Hit** at **+9 or greater** instead of **+10 or greater** and a roll a **19** on a **d20** is considered a **Critical Success Hit**.

However [[Attributes#Wits (WIT)|Wits]] **can not reduce** a Hit Range below a **+2 or greater**, a **Heavy Hit** can not go below **+2 or greater**, a **Brutal Hit** at **+2 or greater** and a roll a **2** on a **d20** is the minimum value that can be considered a **Critical Success Hit**.

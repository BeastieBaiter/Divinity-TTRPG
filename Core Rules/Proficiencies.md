Proficiencies represent a creature’s ability to perform certain actions. 

For example a player might want to negotiate the price of a certain item with vendor, in this scenario they could use the [[#Bartering]] Skill to convince the vendor. 

Unlike most RPGs Proficiencies are not tied to any particular [[Attributes|Attribute]] ([[Attributes#Strength (STR)|Strength]], [[Attributes#Finesse (FIN)|Finesse]], [[Attributes#Constitution (CON)|Constitution]], [[Attributes#Intelligence (INT)|Intelligence]], [[Attributes#Memory (MEM)|Memory]] or [[Attributes#Wits (WIT)|Wits]]).  Which Attribute you use for a given Proficiency Check depends on how you’re performing the Proficiency. Its up to the Players and GM to discuss and get creative with Attributes for Checks, but the GM always retains the final say to decide which Attribute players use for the Check.

Guidelines and Rules for determining the Attribute and Proficiency for a [[Proficiency Check]] are outlined in the [[Checks and Saves]] page.

Proficiencies are split into 2 main categories. [[#Combat Proficiencies]], which is then divided into 3 sub-categories: [[#Weapon Proficiencies]], [[#Defence Proficiencies]] and [[#Skill Proficiencies]]. And [[#Civil Proficiencies]], which are also  divided into 3 sub-categories: [[#Personality Proficiencies]], [[#Craftmanship Proficiencies]] and [[#Cunning Proficiencies]]. These 2 main categories, allow players to tailor their character's strengths to their preferred playstyle in both combat and in roleplay.

Players acquire 2 combat proficiency points at Level 1 and 1 point per level beyond it. 
Player acquire 2 civil proficiency points at Level 1 and 1 point at every 3rd level. 
For more details see the [[Level Up Table]].
